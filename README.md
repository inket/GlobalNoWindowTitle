- Hides the window title, and icon if there's any.
 
-

- Use at your own risk.
- Might be incompatible with some apps. (say, if the app is dependant on the title of its windows, which only a stupid dev would do)
- Doesn't activate on GC-enabled apps. (I'm a sucker for ARC)
- If you use any of my other SIMBL plugins (namely, GlobalNoWindowIcon, NoWindowIcon or NoWindowTitle), you should remove them before installing this one. Otherwise, this plugin won't activate.

-

- Tested on 10.8.2 and 10.9.2 with EasySIMBL.

-

Quick tip: If you want to limit it to a single app, see line 31 in *GlobalNoWindowTitle-Info.plist*, and change the **\*** to your app's bundle id. E.g. *com.apple.finder* for to limit it to Finder.
